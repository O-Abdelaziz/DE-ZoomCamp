# Data Engineering Zoomcamp 2026

This repo contains my homework solutions for the Data Engineering Zoomcamp course.

## Week 1: Docker & SQL

For the first week, I worked with Docker containers and PostgreSQL to analyze NYC taxi trip data. The homework involved setting up a local database environment and running SQL queries to answer questions about the green taxi trips from November 2025.

Check out [week1/Homework solution](week1/Homework%20solution/) for my approach and code.

## Week 2: Workflow Orchestration

The second week was about workflow orchestration using Kestra. I created flows to process NYC taxi data for 2020 and 2021, working with both yellow and green taxi datasets to answer questions about data volumes and file sizes.

See [week2](week2/) for the flow definitions and results.
